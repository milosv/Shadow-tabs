##Tabs with Shadows##

Not sure if anyone has done this before but I needed it for a project and I started to think of the best way to do it. 

I am using pseudo selectors to cover the shadow in order to make a different shape. (:after, :before)

NOTE: The first link is kind of a mess now but I am thinking of ways to make it look better.
